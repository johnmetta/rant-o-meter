h1. The WordPress Rant-o-Meter

<img src="https://github.com/johnmetta/rant-o-meter/raw/master/chart.png" />

This is a silly little plugin that I created for WordPress that allows you to shortcode a small scale to define how much of a rant your post is. A sum total of 40 minutes went into creating it, so don't expect much. I may clean it up a bit and post it in the WordPress plugin list, but that won't happen until I create an admin page to hold default values instead of hardcoding defaults in the plugin.

h2. Installation

Just copy the source or click the "download link":https://github.com/johnmetta/rant-o-meter/archives/master and dump the resulting folder into your plugins directory.

h2. Usage

Within your post, use the shortcode [rant] to see results.

h3. Options

* level (Integer): between 0 and 100 signifying your level of "rant-i-ness" (default: 5)
* mood (String): A word describing your mood (default: blank)
* bottom (String): A word describing the bottom (happy part) of the scale (default: "Oregon")
* top (String): A word describing the top (angry part) of the scale (default: "New York")
* startcolor (hex): RRGGBB Hex code describing the start color (default: 00cc00)
* endcolor (hex): RRGGBB Hex code describing the end color (default: cc0000)
* align (String): Choice of "left" or "right" to align the image (default: right)
* height (integer): Height in pixels of the resulting image (default: 200)
* width (integer): Width in pixels of the resulting image (default: 110)
* show_caption (Boolean): 0 or 1 describing whether you want a caption off or on (default: 1)
